# What does it do?
It will apply credit for KOs, based on direct damage, hazards, status, and status resulting from hazards.
This is intended primarily as a tool to facilitate Draft League management.

# To use...
  1. Download a replay of the match you want tabulated from Showdown
  2. Rename the replay to "matchData.txt"
  3. Add this file to the folder containing "main.py"
  4. Run it!

# Limitations
Does not credit correctly for KOs resulting from the following...
  - Non-major status conditions (Perish Song / Curse / Confusion)
  - KO's not resulting from direct damage / status / hazards
  
# Suggestions?
This was designed as a one-night project to help automate some of the Draft League process; as a result, I don't expect this to be perfect.  If there are significant flaws / annoyances, feel free to make corrections or post an issue.  However, it may take me a while to address issues if they are posted.
